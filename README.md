# tasky-electron
This is a project written in electron to create timers, start a selected timer, deactivate the selected timer, change default time settings, etc. The app is not traditional because it sits on the system tray, this being the speciality.

# tray icon click causes open-close toggle.
# right click to quit the app.
# blur away hides the window.
